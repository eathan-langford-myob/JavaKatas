# README

## Purpose:
This is a repo of all my Katas and excersizes I've worked on to sharpen my skills while in my early days at MYOB.

### Katas:
Here are the Katas I've worked on, in order:
* FizzBuzz - Prints numbers 1-100, and if the number is divisible by 3 it prints Fizz, 5 it prints Buzz and both it prints FizzBuzz.
* ABC Blocks - Takes a string and compares against a set of 20 ABC blocks to see if you can build the word.
* Magic Year Calculator - User inputs their First and Last name, annual salary and year starting work. The program then works out their monthly salary, their 'magic year' which is 65 years after starting work, and concatenates their name.
* BlackJack - Your standard blackjack rules as a CLI app.
